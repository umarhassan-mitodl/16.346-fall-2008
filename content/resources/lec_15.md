description: Lecture notes on the fundamental ellipse of the BVP, orbital elements
  of the fundamental (minimum eccentricity) ellipse, locus of mean points, the line
  segment FS, eccentric anomaly of the mean-point, mean-point radius of the parabolic
  orbit, and mean-point radius of elliptic and hyperbolic orbits.
