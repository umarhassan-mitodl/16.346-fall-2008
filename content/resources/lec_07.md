description: Lecture notes on optimum orbital transfer, velocity requirements for
  orbital transfer, optimum single-impulse transfer, the optimality condition, optimum
  single-impulse transfer from a circular orbit, solving the general optimization
  problem by successive substitutions, Earth-to-Mars departure velocity for orbital
  transfer, and minimum departure velocity for orbital transfer from Earth to the
  planets.
