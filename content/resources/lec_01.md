Lecture notes on Newton's two-body equations of motion, conservation of total linear momentum, two-body equation of relative motion, vector notation, Kepler’s second law, eccentricity vector, Kepler’s first law, Kepler’s third law, units for numerical calculations, Josiah Eillard Gibbs (1839-1908), and Gibb’s method of orbit determination.
